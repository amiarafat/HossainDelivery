Google Map Api Key: 
Here I use google maps and thus I have to add a google api key, So I just created a project ofmy own and use akey from it. 
If you want you can use your own api key.
I put my key on 
res > values > google_maps_api(debug)
so you need to put the api key there. 

I also added a test class to test RecyclerView Item Click listener UI test using Espresso.
